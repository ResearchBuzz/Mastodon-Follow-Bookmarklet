# Mastodon-Follow-Bookmarklet
A bookmarklet that makes it easy to follow Mastodon users on different instances. 

Bookmarklets are browser bookmarks that use JavaScript. This one makes it easy to follow Mastodon users on other instances without a lot of hoop-jumping. Here's how to use it:

1. Grab the JavaScript. Change the YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME_HERE part of the code to your instance name. 

2. Save this code as a bookmark, ideally in your bookmarks bar. 

3. When you want to follow someone from another Mastodon instance, highlight their username and click on your bookmarklet. (If you click without highlighting you'll be prompted for a user name.) After you click, you'll be taken to a follow confirmation page on your instance. Easy peasy!
